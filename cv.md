## About me

I have 20 years of successful practical experience of development with strictly typed programming languages in industrial sphere and deep knowledge of OOP. Now I am <span class="bold">lead software engineer</span>. But every day I strive for perfection and self-development and now decided to change the technology and sphere of programming. I became passionate about web-technologies, connected with C#, .NET Core, JavaScript, TypeScript. I have a lot of Back-end development experience in C# and .NET Core and I want to become a full-stach developer.
My goal of learning on the course is to gain new knowledge in front-end development. I have global knowledge in other poisons, but this direction is new to me. Since I am an experienced developer, learning new technologies is not difficult for me, I learn quickly and productively.
